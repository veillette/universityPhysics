<p id="fs-id1172101037573">So far in this chapter, we have been discussing optical phenomena using the ray model of light. However, some phenomena require analysis and explanations based on the wave characteristics of light. This is particularly true when the wavelength is not negligible compared to the dimensions of an optical device, such as a slit in the case of <em data-effect="italics">diffraction</em>. Huygens&#8217;s principle is an indispensable tool for this analysis.</p>
<p id="fs-id1172100799924"><a href="#CNX_UPhysics_34_06_Wave" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows how a transverse wave looks as viewed from above and from the side. A light wave can be imagined to propagate like this, although we do not actually see it wiggling through space. From above, we view the wave fronts (or wave crests) as if we were looking down on ocean waves. The side view would be a graph of the electric or magnetic field. The view from above is perhaps more useful in developing concepts about <span data-type="term">wave optics</span>.</p>

<p id="fs-id1172100525973">The Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens (1629&#8211;1695) developed a useful technique for determining in detail how and where waves propagate. Starting from some known position, <span data-type="term">Huygens&#8217;s principle</span> states that every point on a wave front is a source of wavelets that spread out in the forward direction at the same speed as the wave itself. The new wave front is tangent to all of the wavelets.</p>
<p id="fs-id1172098457484"><a href="#CNX_UPhysics_34_06_Lines" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows how Huygens&#8217;s principle is applied. A wave front is the long edge that moves, for example, with the crest or the trough. Each point on the wave front emits a semicircular wave that moves at the propagation speed <em data-effect="italics">v</em>. We can draw these wavelets at a time <em data-effect="italics">t</em> later, so that they have moved a distance <math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" display="inline"><semantics><mrow><mrow><mi>s</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>v</mi><mi>t</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content"><mrow><mi>s</mi><mo>=</mo><mi>v</mi><mi>t</mi><mo>.</mo></mrow></annotation-xml></semantics></math> The new wave front is a plane tangent to the wavelets and is where we would expect the wave to be a time <em data-effect="italics">t</em> later. Huygens&#8217;s principle works for all types of waves, including water waves, sound waves, and light waves. It is useful not only in describing how light waves propagate but also in explaining the laws of reflection and refraction. In addition, we will see that Huygens&#8217;s principle tells us how and where light rays interfere.</p>

<p id="fs-id1172100969206"><a href="#CNX_UPhysics_34_06_Mirror" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> shows how a mirror reflects an incoming wave at an angle equal to the incident angle, verifying the law of reflection. As the wave front strikes the mirror, wavelets are first emitted from the left part of the mirror and then from the right. The wavelets closer to the left have had time to travel farther, producing a wave front traveling in the direction shown.</p>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1172100967664"><h3 data-type="title">Refraction</h3>
<p id="fs-id1172100574975">The law of refraction can be explained by applying Huygens&#8217;s principle to a wave front passing from one medium to another (<a href="#CNX_UPhysics_34_06_Surface" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Each wavelet in the figure was emitted when the wave front crossed the interface between the media. Since the speed of light is smaller in the second medium, the waves do not travel as far in a given time, and the new wave front changes direction as shown. This explains why a ray changes direction to become closer to the perpendicular when light slows down. Snell&#8217;s law can be derived from the geometry in <a href="#CNX_UPhysics_34_06_Surface" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> (<a href="#fs-id1172100635976" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
<figure id="CNX_UPhysics_34_06_Surface"><figcaption>Huygens&#8217;s principle applied to a plane wave front traveling from one medium to another, where its speed is less. The ray bends toward the perpendicular, since the wavelets have a lower speed in the second medium.</figcaption>
<span data-type="media" id="fs-id1172101029226" data-alt="The figure shows two media separated by a horizontal line labeled surface. The upper medium is labeled medium one and the lower medium is labeled medium two. In medium one, a ray is incident on the surface, traveling down and to the right. A vertical dotted line, perpendicular to the surface, is drawn through both media where the ray hits the surface. The refracted ray bends down, toward this dotted line where it enters medium two. The path of the ray makes an angle theta sub one with the dotted line in medium one and an angle theta sub two with the dotted line in medium two, where theta sub two is less than theta sub one. Line segments, labeled wave front, are drawn perpendicular to the incident ray and the refracted ray. These line segments are equally spaced within each medium, but the three line segments in medium 1 are more widely spaced than the three line segments in medium 2. The separation of these line segments in medium 1 is labeled v sub one t and the separation in medium 2 is labeled v sub two t, with v sub two t being less than v sub one t.">

<p id="fs-id1172100596387">What happens when a wave passes through an opening, such as light shining through an open door into a dark room? For light, we observe a sharp shadow of the doorway on the floor of the room, and no visible light bends around corners into other parts of the room. When sound passes through a door, we hear it everywhere in the room and thus observe that sound spreads out when passing through such an opening (<a href="#CNX_UPhysics_34_06_Door" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). What is the difference between the behavior of sound waves and light waves in this case? The answer is that light has very short wavelengths and acts like a ray. Sound has wavelengths on the order of the size of the door and bends around corners (for frequency of 1000 Hz,</p>

<p id="fs-id1172100836637">If we pass light through smaller openings such as slits, we can use Huygens&#8217;s principle to see that light bends as sound does (<a href="#CNX_UPhysics_34_06_Opening" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). The bending of a wave around the edges of an opening or an obstacle is called diffraction. Diffraction is a wave characteristic and occurs for all types of waves. If diffraction is observed for some phenomenon, it is evidence that the phenomenon is a wave. Thus, the horizontal diffraction of the laser beam after it passes through the slits in <a href="#CNX_UPhysics_34_06_Opening" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> is evidence that light is a wave. You will learn about diffraction in much more detail in the chapter on <a href="/contents/530d811a-3df9-4913-9c8b-5844eae74384">Diffraction</a>.</p>
