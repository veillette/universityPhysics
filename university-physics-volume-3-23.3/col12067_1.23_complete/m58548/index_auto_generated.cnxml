<para id="fs-id1172102062471">Light diffracts as it moves through space, bending around obstacles, interfering constructively and destructively. This can be used as a spectroscopic tool—a diffraction grating disperses light according to wavelength, for example, and is used to produce spectra—but diffraction also limits the detail we can obtain in images.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172101665463"><link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_37_05_Light"/>(a) shows the effect of passing light through a small circular <term class="no-emphasis">aperture</term>. Instead of a bright spot with sharp edges, we obtain a spot with a fuzzy edge surrounded by circles of light. This pattern is caused by diffraction, similar to that produced by a single slit. Light from different parts of the circular aperture interferes constructively and destructively. The effect is most noticeable when the aperture is small, but the effect is there for large apertures as well.</para>

The pattern is similar to that for a single point source, and it is still possible to tell that there are two light sources rather than one. If they are closer together, as in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_37_05_Light"/>(c), we cannot distinguish them, thus limiting the detail or <term>resolution</term> we can obtain. This limit is an inescapable consequence of the wave nature of light.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172101688448">Diffraction limits the resolution in many situations. The acuity of our vision is limited because light passes through the pupil, which is the circular aperture of the eye. Be aware that the diffraction-like spreading of light is due to the limited diameter of a light beam, not the interaction with an aperture. Thus, light passing through a lens with a diameter <emphasis effect="italics">D</emphasis> shows this effect and spreads, blurring the image, just as light passing through an aperture of diameter <emphasis effect="italics">D</emphasis> does. Thus, diffraction limits the resolution of any system having a lens or mirror. Telescopes are also limited by diffraction, because of the finite diameter <emphasis effect="italics">D</emphasis> of the primary mirror.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172101945964">Just what is the limit? To answer that question, consider the diffraction pattern for a circular aperture, which has a central maximum that is wider and brighter than the maxima surrounding it (similar to a slit) (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_37_05_Bulb"/>(a)). It can be shown that, for a circular aperture of diameter <emphasis effect="italics">D</emphasis>, the first minimum in the diffraction pattern occurs at <m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>θ</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mn>1.22</m:mn><m:mtext>λ</m:mtext><m:mtext>/</m:mtext><m:mi>D</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math> (providing the aperture is large compared with the wavelength of light, which is the case for most optical instruments). The accepted criterion for determining the <term>diffraction limit</term> to resolution based on this angle is known as the <term>Rayleigh criterion</term>, which was developed by Lord Rayleigh in the nineteenth century.</para>

<para id="fs-id1172101772757">All attempts to observe the size and shape of objects are limited by the wavelength of the probe. Even the small wavelength of light prohibits exact precision. When extremely small wavelength probes are used, as with an electron microscope, the system is disturbed, still limiting our knowledge. Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle asserts that this limit is fundamental and inescapable, as we shall see in the chapter on quantum mechanics.</para>

<para id="fs-id1172101793898"><title>Significance</title>
The angle found in part (a) is extraordinarily small (less than 1/50,000 of a degree), because the primary mirror is so large compared with the wavelength of light. As noticed, diffraction effects are most noticeable when light interacts with objects having sizes on the order of the wavelength of light. However, the effect is still there, and there is a diffraction limit to what is observable. The actual resolution of the Hubble Telescope is not quite as good as that found here. As with all instruments, there are other effects, such as nonuniformities in mirrors or aberrations in lenses that further limit resolution. However, <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_37_05_Galaxy"/> gives an indication of the extent of the detail observable with the Hubble because of its size and quality, and especially because it is above Earth’s atmosphere.</para>

The average distance between stars in a galaxy is on the order of five light-years in the outer parts and about one light-year near the galactic center. Therefore, the Hubble can resolve most of the individual stars in Andromeda Galaxy, even though it lies at such a huge distance that its light takes 2 million years to reach us. <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_37_05_Bowl"/> shows another mirror used to observe radio waves from outer space.</para><figure id="CNX_UPhysics_37_05_Bowl">

<caption>A 305-m-diameter paraboloid at Arecibo in Puerto Rico is lined with reflective material, making it into a radio telescope. It is the largest curved focusing dish in the world. Although <emphasis effect="italics">D</emphasis> for Arecibo is much larger than for the Hubble Telescope, it detects radiation of a much longer wavelength and its diffraction limit is significantly poorer than Hubble’s. The Arecibo telescope is still very useful, because important information is carried by radio waves that is not carried by visible light. (credit: Jeff Hitchcock)</caption>

<para id="fs-id1172101949137">In a microscope, <emphasis effect="italics">NA</emphasis> is important because it relates to the resolving power of a lens. A lens with a large <emphasis effect="italics">NA</emphasis> is able to resolve finer details. Lenses with larger <emphasis effect="italics">NA</emphasis> are also able to collect more light and so give a brighter image. Another way to describe this situation is that the larger the <emphasis effect="italics">NA</emphasis>, the larger the cone of light that can be brought into the lens, so more of the diffraction modes are collected. Thus the microscope has more information to form a clear image, and its resolving power is higher.</para>

<para id="fs-id1172102025537">One of the consequences of diffraction is that the focal point of a beam has a finite width and intensity distribution. Imagine focusing when only considering geometric optics, as in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_37_05_Focal"/>(a). The focal point is regarded as an infinitely small point with a huge intensity and the capacity to incinerate most samples, irrespective of the <emphasis effect="italics">NA</emphasis> of the objective lens—an unphysical oversimplification. For wave optics, due to diffraction, we take into account the phenomenon in which the focal point spreads to become a focal spot (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_37_05_Focal"/>(b)) with the size of the spot decreasing with increasing <emphasis effect="italics">NA</emphasis>. Consequently, the intensity in the focal spot increases with increasing <emphasis effect="italics">NA</emphasis>. The higher the <emphasis effect="italics">NA</emphasis>, the greater the chances of photodegrading the specimen. However, the spot never becomes a true point.</para>

<para id="fs-id1172102067565">In a different type of microscope, molecules within a specimen are made to emit light through a mechanism called fluorescence. By controlling the molecules emitting light, it has become possible to construct images with resolution much finer than the Rayleigh criterion, thus circumventing the diffraction limit. The development of super-resolved fluorescence microscopy led to the 2014 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</para>
