<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1165039424848"><h3 data-type="title">About OpenStax</h3>
<p id="fs-id1165039367577">OpenStax is a nonprofit based at Rice University, and it&#8217;s our mission to improve student access to education. Our first openly licensed college textbook was published in 2012 and our library has since scaled to over 25 books used by hundreds of thousands of students across the globe. OpenStax Tutor, our low-cost personalized learning tool, is being used in college courses throughout the country. The OpenStax mission is made possible through the generous support of philanthropic foundations. Through these partnerships and with the help of additional low-cost resources from our OpenStax partners, OpenStax is breaking down the most common barriers to learning and empowering students and instructors to succeed.</p></section>

<section data-depth="1" id="fs-id1165039394449"><h3 data-type="title">About <em data-effect="italics">University Physics</em></h3>
<p id="fs-id1165039123713"><em data-effect="italics">University Physics</em> is designed for the two- or three-semester calculus-based physics course. The text has been developed to meet the scope and sequence of most university physics courses and provides a foundation for a career in mathematics, science, or engineering. The book provides an important opportunity for students to learn the core concepts of physics and understand how those concepts apply to their lives and to the world around them.</p>
<p id="eip-133">Due to the comprehensive nature of the material, we are offering the book in three volumes for flexibility and efficiency.</p><section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1165039111640"><h4 data-type="title">Coverage and scope</h4><p id="fs-id1165039091394">Our <em data-effect="italics">University Physics</em> textbook adheres to the scope and sequence of most two- and three-semester physics courses nationwide. We have worked to make physics interesting and accessible to students while maintaining the mathematical rigor inherent in the subject. With this objective in mind, the content of this textbook has been developed and arranged to provide a logical progression from fundamental to more advanced concepts, building upon what students have already learned and emphasizing connections between topics and between theory and applications. The goal of each section is to enable students not just to recognize concepts, but to work with them in ways that will be useful in later courses and future careers. The organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with feedback from science educators dedicated to the project.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1165038961942"><h4 data-type="title">Pedagogical foundation</h4><p id="fs-id1165039196055">Throughout <em data-effect="italics">University Physics</em> you will find derivations of concepts that present classical ideas and techniques, as well as modern applications and methods. Most chapters start with observations or experiments that place the material in a context of physical experience. Presentations and explanations rely on years of classroom experience on the part of long-time physics professors, striving for a balance of clarity and rigor that has proven successful with their students. Throughout the text, links enable students to review earlier material and then return to the present discussion, reinforcing connections between topics. Key historical figures and experiments are discussed in the main text (rather than in boxes or sidebars), maintaining a focus on the development of physical intuition. Key ideas, definitions, and equations are highlighted in the text and listed in summary form at the end of each chapter. Examples and chapter-opening images often include contemporary applications from daily life or modern science and engineering that students can relate to, from smart phones to the internet to GPS devices.</p>

<section data-depth="2" id="fs-id1165039091879"><h4 data-type="title">Assessments that reinforce key concepts</h4><p id="fs-id1165039247386">In-chapter <strong data-effect="bold">Examples</strong> generally follow a three-part format of Strategy, Solution, and Significance to emphasize how to approach a problem, how to work with the equations, and how to check and generalize the result. Examples are often followed by <strong data-effect="bold">Check Your Understanding</strong> questions and answers to help reinforce for students the important ideas of the examples. <strong data-effect="bold">Problem-Solving Strategies</strong> in each chapter break down methods of approaching various types of problems into steps students can follow for guidance. The book also includes exercises at the end of each chapter so students can practice what they&#8217;ve learned.</p>
<ul id="fs-id1165039044333" data-bullet-style="none"><li><strong data-effect="bold">Conceptual questions</strong> do not require calculation but test student learning of the key concepts.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Problems</strong> categorized by section test student problem-solving skills and the ability to apply ideas to practical situations.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Additional Problems</strong> apply knowledge across the chapter, forcing students to identify what concepts and equations are appropriate for solving given problems. Randomly located throughout the problems are <strong data-effect="bold">Unreasonable Results</strong> exercises that ask students to evaluate the answer to a problem and explain why it is not reasonable and what assumptions made might not be correct.</li>
<li><strong data-effect="bold">Challenge Problems</strong> extend text ideas to interesting but difficult situations.</li>
</ul><p id="fs-id1165038994270">Answers for selected exercises are available in an <strong data-effect="bold">Answer Key</strong> at the end of the book.</p>
