<para id="fs-id1172100851039">We expect to see reflections from smooth surfaces, but <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_02_Diffusion"/> illustrates how a rough surface reflects light. Since the light strikes different parts of the surface at different angles, it is reflected in many different directions, or diffused. <term class="no-emphasis">Diffused light</term> is what allows us to see a sheet of paper from any angle, as shown in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_02_PapMirLake"/>(a). People, clothing, leaves, and walls all have rough surfaces and can be seen from all sides. A mirror, on the other hand, has a smooth surface (compared with the wavelength of light) and reflects light at specific angles, as illustrated in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_02_PapMirLake"/>(b). When the Moon reflects from a lake, as shown in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_02_PapMirLake"/>(c), a combination of these effects takes place.</para>

Reflected light reaches eyes placed at many location. Figure b shows the rays of light from a flashlight falling on mirror. All of the light gets reflected at the same angle since the surface is smooth. Reflected light only reaches an eye placed so that the reflected beam hits it. An observer not at the angle of the reflected light does not see it. Figure c shows a photograph of moonlight falling on a lake. The lake’s shiny surface reflects it. A bright , slightly rippled strip of moonlight is seen reflecting from the lake on a dark background.">

<caption>(a) When a sheet of paper is illuminated with many parallel incident rays, it can be seen at many different angles, because its surface is rough and diffuses the light. (b) A mirror illuminated by many parallel rays reflects them in only one direction, because its surface is very smooth. Only the observer at a particular angle sees the reflected light. (c) Moonlight is spread out when it is reflected by the lake, because the surface is shiny but uneven. (credit c: modification of work by Diego Torres Silvestre)</caption>

<para id="fs-id1172100625460">When you see yourself in a mirror, it appears that the image is actually behind the mirror (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_02_MirrorImg"/>). We see the light coming from a direction determined by the law of reflection. The angles are such that the image is exactly the same distance behind the mirror as you stand in front of the mirror. If the mirror is on the wall of a room, the images in it are all behind the mirror, which can make the room seem bigger. Although these mirror images make objects appear to be where they cannot be (like behind a solid wall), the images are not figments of your imagination. Mirror images can be photographed and videotaped by instruments and look just as they do with our eyes (which are optical instruments themselves). The precise manner in which images are formed by mirrors and lenses is discussed in an upcoming chapter on <link document="m58526">Geometric Optics and Image Formation</link>.</para>

The mirror is about half as tall as the girl, with the top of the mirror above her eyes but below the top of her head.  The light rays from her feet reach the bottom of the mirror and reflect to her eyes following the law of reflection: the angle of incidence theta is equal to the angle of reflection theta. The rays from the top of her head reach the top of the mirror and reflect to her eyes. Figure b is a drawing of the same girl looking at her twin. The twin is facing her and is at the same location, relative to her, that her image is in figure a. The rays from the twin’s feet and head travel directly to the girl’s eyes, reaching them in the same direction as the reflected rays in figure a.">

<title>Corner Reflectors (Retroreflectors)</title>
<para id="fs-id1172098452569">A light ray that strikes an object consisting of two mutually perpendicular reflecting surfaces is reflected back exactly parallel to the direction from which it came (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_02_TwoMirrors"/>). This is true whenever the reflecting surfaces are perpendicular, and it is independent of the angle of incidence. (For proof, see <link target-id="fs-id1172098560163"/> at the end of this section.) Such an object is called a <term>corner reflector</term>, since the light bounces from its inside corner. Corner reflectors are a subclass of retroreflectors, which all reflect rays back in the directions from which they came. Although the geometry of the proof is much more complex, corner reflectors can also be built with three mutually perpendicular reflecting surfaces and are useful in three-dimensional applications.</para>

<para id="fs-id1172098449740">Many inexpensive reflector buttons on bicycles, cars, and warning signs have corner reflectors designed to return light in the direction from which it originated. Rather than simply reflecting light over a wide angle, retroreflection ensures high visibility if the observer and the light source are located together, such as a car’s driver and headlights. The Apollo astronauts placed a true corner reflector on the Moon (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_02_CornRefl"/>). Laser signals from Earth can be bounced from that corner reflector to measure the gradually increasing distance to the Moon of a few centimeters per year.</para>

<para id="fs-id1172100617052">Working on the same principle as these optical reflectors, corner reflectors are routinely used as radar reflectors (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_34_02_RadarRef"/>) for radio-frequency applications. Under most circumstances, small boats made of fiberglass or wood do not strongly reflect radio waves emitted by radar systems. To make these boats visible to radar (to avoid collisions, for example), radar reflectors are attached to boats, usually in high places.</para>
