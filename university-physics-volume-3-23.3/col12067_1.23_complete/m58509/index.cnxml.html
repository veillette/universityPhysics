People, clothing, leaves, and walls all have rough surfaces and can be seen from all sides. A mirror, on the other hand, has a smooth surface (compared with the wavelength of light) and reflects light at specific angles, as illustrated in <a href="#CNX_UPhysics_34_02_PapMirLake" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>(b). When the Moon reflects from a lake, as shown in <a href="#CNX_UPhysics_34_02_PapMirLake" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>(c), a combination of these effects takes place.</p>

<p id="fs-id1172100625460">When you see yourself in a mirror, it appears that the image is actually behind the mirror (<a href="#CNX_UPhysics_34_02_MirrorImg" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). We see the light coming from a direction determined by the law of reflection. The angles are such that the image is exactly the same distance behind the mirror as you stand in front of the mirror. If the mirror is on the wall of a room, the images in it are all behind the mirror, which can make the room seem bigger. Although these mirror images make objects appear to be where they cannot be (like behind a solid wall), the images are not figments of your imagination. Mirror images can be photographed and videotaped by instruments and look just as they do with our eyes (which are optical instruments themselves). The precise manner in which images are formed by mirrors and lenses is discussed in an upcoming chapter on <a href="/contents/f9896b03-435e-4b86-83cb-76ee7d4af769">Geometric Optics and Image Formation</a>.</p>

<p id="fs-id1172098452569">A light ray that strikes an object consisting of two mutually perpendicular reflecting surfaces is reflected back exactly parallel to the direction from which it came (<a href="#CNX_UPhysics_34_02_TwoMirrors" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). This is true whenever the reflecting surfaces are perpendicular, and it is independent of the angle of incidence. (For proof, see <a href="#fs-id1172098560163" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a> at the end of this section.) Such an object is called a <span data-type="term">corner reflector</span>, since the light bounces from its inside corner. Corner reflectors are a subclass of retroreflectors, which all reflect rays back in the directions from which they came. Although the geometry of the proof is much more complex, corner reflectors can also be built with three mutually perpendicular reflecting surfaces and are useful in three-dimensional applications.</p>

<p id="fs-id1172098449740">Many inexpensive reflector buttons on bicycles, cars, and warning signs have corner reflectors designed to return light in the direction from which it originated. Rather than simply reflecting light over a wide angle, retroreflection ensures high visibility if the observer and the light source are located together, such as a car&#8217;s driver and headlights. The Apollo astronauts placed a true corner reflector on the Moon (<a href="#CNX_UPhysics_34_02_CornRefl" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). Laser signals from Earth can be bounced from that corner reflector to measure the gradually increasing distance to the Moon of a few centimeters per year.</p>

<p id="fs-id1172100617052">Working on the same principle as these optical reflectors, corner reflectors are routinely used as radar reflectors (<a href="#CNX_UPhysics_34_02_RadarRef" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>) for radio-frequency applications. Under most circumstances, small boats made of fiberglass or wood do not strongly reflect radio waves emitted by radar systems. To make these boats visible to radar (to avoid collisions, for example), radar reflectors are attached to boats, usually in high places.</p>
