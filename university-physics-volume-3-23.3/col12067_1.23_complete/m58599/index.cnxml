<para id="fs-id1172101900682">The free electron model explains many important properties of conductors but is weak in at least two areas. First, it assumes a constant potential energy within the solid. (Recall that a constant potential energy is associated with no forces.) <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_42_05_Coulomb"/> compares the assumption of a constant potential energy (dotted line) with the periodic Coulomb potential, which drops as <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>−1</m:mn><m:mtext>/</m:mtext><m:mi>r</m:mi></m:mrow></m:math> at each lattice point, where <emphasis effect="italics">r</emphasis> is the distance from the ion core (solid line). Second, the free electron model assumes an impenetrable barrier at the surface. This assumption is not valid, because under certain conditions, electrons can escape the surface—such as in the photoelectric effect. In addition to these assumptions, the free electron model does not explain the dramatic differences in electronic properties of conductors, semiconductors, and insulators. Therefore, a more complete model is needed.</para>

<para id="fs-id1172101758889">We can produce an improved model by solving Schrödinger’s equation for the periodic potential shown in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_42_05_Coulomb"/>. However, the solution requires technical mathematics far beyond our scope. We again seek a qualitative argument based on quantum mechanics to find a way forward.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172099660684">We first review the argument used to explain the energy structure of a covalent bond. Consider two identical hydrogen atoms so far apart that there is no interaction whatsoever between them. Further suppose that the electron in each atom is in the same ground state: a 1<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> electron with an energy of <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>−13.6</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>eV</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math> (ignore spin). When the hydrogen atoms are brought closer together, the individual wave functions of the electrons overlap and, by the exclusion principle, can no longer be in the same quantum state, which splits the original equivalent energy levels into two different energy levels. The energies of these levels depend on the interatomic distance, <m:math><m:mi>α</m:mi></m:math> (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_42_05_EnLevSplit"/>).</para>
<para id="fs-id1172099627892">If four hydrogen atoms are brought together, four levels are formed from the four possible symmetries—a single sine wave “hump” in each well, alternating up and down, and so on. In the limit of a very large number <emphasis effect="italics">N</emphasis> of atoms, we expect a spread of nearly continuous bands of electronic energy levels in a solid (see <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_42_05_EnLevSplit"/>(c)). Each of these bands is known as an <term>energy band</term>. (The allowed states of energy and wave number are still technically quantized, but for large numbers of atoms, these states are so close together that they are consider to be continuous or “in the continuum.”)</para>
<para id="fs-id1172102031756">Energy bands differ in the number of electrons they hold. In the 1<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> and 2<emphasis effect="italics">s</emphasis> energy bands, each energy level holds up to two electrons (spin up and spin down), so this band has a maximum occupancy of 2<emphasis effect="italics">N</emphasis> electrons. In the 2<emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis> energy band, each energy level holds up to six electrons, so this band has a maximum occupancy of 6<emphasis effect="italics">N</emphasis> electrons (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_42_05_EnBands"/>).</para>

<para id="fs-id1172102040645">Each energy band is separated from the other by an <term>energy gap</term>. The electrical properties of conductors and insulators can be understood in terms of energy bands and gaps. The highest energy band that is filled is known as a <term>valence band</term>. The next available band in the energy structure is known as a <term>conduction band</term>. In a conductor, the highest energy band that contains electrons is partially filled, whereas in an insulator, the highest energy band containing electrons is completely filled. The difference between a conductor and insulator is illustrated in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_42_05_HighEnBand"/>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1172099683005">A conductor differs from an insulator in how its electrons respond to an applied electric field. If a significant number of electrons are set into motion by the field, the material is a conductor. In terms of the band model, electrons in the partially filled conduction band gain kinetic energy from the electric field by filling higher energy states in the conduction band. By contrast, in an insulator, electrons belong to completely filled bands. When the field is applied, the electrons cannot make such transitions (acquire kinetic energy from the electric field) due to the exclusion principle. As a result, the material does not conduct electricity.</para>

</note>
<para id="fs-id1172099473560">A <term>semiconductor</term> has a similar energy structure to an insulator except it has a relatively small energy gap between the lowest completely filled band and the next available unfilled band. This type of material forms the basis of modern electronics. At <m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>T</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mn>0</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>K</m:mtext></m:mrow></m:math>, the semiconductor and insulator both have completely filled bands. The only difference is in the size of the energy gap (or <emphasis effect="italics">band gap</emphasis>) <emphasis effect="italics">E<sub>g</sub></emphasis> between the highest energy band that is filled (the valence band) and the next-higher empty band (the conduction band). In a semiconductor, this gap is small enough that a substantial number of electrons from the valence band are thermally excited into the conduction band at room temperature. These electrons are then in a nearly empty band and can respond to an applied field. As a general rule of thumb, the band gap of a semiconductor is about 1 eV. (See <link target-id="fs-id1172099415754"/> for silicon.) A band gap of greater than approximately 1 eV is considered an insulator. For comparison, the energy gap of diamond (an insulator) is several electron-volts.</para>
