Note that mass cancels, implying that, in this example, it does not matter how heavily loaded the car is to negotiate the turn. Mass cancels because friction is assumed proportional to the normal force, which in turn is proportional to mass. If the surface of the road were banked, the normal force would be greater, as discussed next.</para></example>

<title>Inertial Forces and Noninertial (Accelerated) Frames: The Coriolis Force</title>
<para id="fs-id1165038999017">What do taking off in a jet airplane, turning a corner in a car, riding a merry-go-round, and the circular motion of a tropical cyclone have in common? Each exhibits inertial forces—forces that merely seem to arise from motion, because the observer’s frame of reference is accelerating or rotating. When taking off in a jet, most people would agree it feels as if you are being pushed back into the seat as the airplane accelerates down the runway. Yet a physicist would say that <emphasis effect="italics">you</emphasis> tend to remain stationary while the <emphasis effect="italics">seat</emphasis> pushes forward on you. An even more common experience occurs when you make a tight curve in your car—say, to the right (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_06_03_RightTurn"/>). You feel as if you are thrown (that is, <emphasis effect="italics">forced</emphasis>) toward the left relative to the car. Again, a physicist would say that <emphasis effect="italics">you</emphasis> are going in a straight line (recall Newton’s first law) but the <emphasis effect="italics">car</emphasis> moves to the right, not that you are experiencing a force from the left.</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-id1165039397195">We can reconcile these points of view by examining the frames of reference used. Let us concentrate on people in a car. Passengers instinctively use the car as a frame of reference, whereas a physicist might use Earth. The physicist might make this choice because Earth is nearly an inertial frame of reference, in which all forces have an identifiable physical origin. In such a frame of reference, Newton’s laws of motion take the form given in <link document="m58294">Newton’s Laws of Motion</link>. The car is a <term>noninertial frame of reference</term> because it is accelerated to the side. The force to the left sensed by car passengers is an <term>inertial force</term> having no physical origin (it is due purely to the inertia of the passenger, not to some physical cause such as tension, friction, or gravitation). The car, as well as the driver, is actually accelerating to the right. This inertial force is said to be an inertial force because it does not have a physical origin, such as gravity.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165039268847">A physicist will choose whatever reference frame is most convenient for the situation being analyzed. There is no problem to a physicist in including inertial forces and Newton’s second law, as usual, if that is more convenient, for example, on a merry-go-round or on a rotating planet. Noninertial (accelerated) frames of reference are used when it is useful to do so. Different frames of reference must be considered in discussing the motion of an astronaut in a spacecraft traveling at speeds near the speed of light, as you will appreciate in the study of the special theory of relativity.</para>

You take the merry-go-round to be your frame of reference because you rotate together. When rotating in that noninertial frame of reference, you feel an inertial force that tends to throw you off; this is often referred to as a <term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">centrifugal force</emphasis></term> (not to be confused with centripetal force). Centrifugal force is a commonly used term, but it does not actually exist. You must hang on tightly to counteract your inertia (which people often refer to as centrifugal force). In Earth’s frame of reference, there is no force trying to throw you off; we emphasize that centrifugal force is a fiction. You must hang on to make yourself go in a circle because otherwise you would go in a straight line, right off the merry-go-round, in keeping with Newton’s first law.

<para id="fs-id1165039345939">Up until now, we have considered Earth to be an inertial frame of reference with little or no worry about effects due to its rotation. Yet such effects <emphasis effect="italics">do</emphasis> exist—in the rotation of weather systems, for example. Most consequences of Earth’s rotation can be qualitatively understood by analogy with the merry-go-round. Viewed from above the North Pole, Earth rotates counterclockwise, as does the merry-go-round in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_06_03_Coriolis"/>. As on the merry-go-round, any motion in Earth’s Northern Hemisphere experiences a Coriolis force to the right. Just the opposite occurs in the Southern Hemisphere; there, the force is to the left. Because Earth’s angular velocity is small, the Coriolis force is usually negligible, but for large-scale motions, such as wind patterns, it has substantial effects.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165039046375">The Coriolis force causes hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere to rotate in the counterclockwise direction, whereas tropical cyclones in the Southern Hemisphere rotate in the clockwise direction. (The terms hurricane, typhoon, and tropical storm are regionally specific names for cyclones, which are storm systems characterized by low pressure centers, strong winds, and heavy rains.) <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_06_03_Hurricane"/> helps show how these rotations take place. Air flows toward any region of low pressure, and tropical cyclones contain particularly low pressures. Thus winds flow toward the center of a tropical cyclone or a low-pressure weather system at the surface. In the Northern Hemisphere, these inward winds are deflected to the right, as shown in the figure, producing a counterclockwise circulation at the surface for low-pressure zones of any type. Low pressure at the surface is associated with rising air, which also produces cooling and cloud formation, making low-pressure patterns quite visible from space. Conversely, wind circulation around high-pressure zones is clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere but is less visible because high pressure is associated with sinking air, producing clear skies.</para>

</figure>
<para id="fs-id1165039316978">The rotation of tropical cyclones and the path of a ball on a merry-go-round can just as well be explained by inertia and the rotation of the system underneath. When noninertial frames are used, inertial forces, such as the Coriolis force, must be invented to explain the curved path. There is no identifiable physical source for these inertial forces. In an inertial frame, inertia explains the path, and no force is found to be without an identifiable source. Either view allows us to describe nature, but a view in an inertial frame is the simplest in the sense that all forces have origins and explanations.</para>

<para id="fs-id1165035687039">Centripetal force is defined as any net force causing uniform circular motion. The centripetal force is not a new kind of force. The label “centripetal” refers to <emphasis effect="italics">any</emphasis> force that keeps something turning in a circle. That force could be tension, gravity, friction, electrical attraction, the normal force, or any other force. Any combination of these could be the source of centripetal force, for example, the centripetal force at the top of the path of a tetherball swung through a vertical circle is the result of both tension and gravity.</para>

<para id="fs-id1165039312717">The driver who cuts the corner (on Path 2) has a more gradual curve, with a larger radius. That one will be the better racing line. If the driver goes too fast around a corner using a racing line, he will still slide off the track; the key is to stay at the maximum value of static friction. So, the driver wants maximum possible speed and maximum friction. Consider the equation for centripetal force: <m:math><m:mrow><m:msub><m:mi>F</m:mi><m:mtext>c</m:mtext></m:msub><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mi>m</m:mi><m:mfrac><m:mrow><m:msup><m:mi>v</m:mi><m:mn>2</m:mn></m:msup></m:mrow><m:mi>r</m:mi></m:mfrac></m:mrow></m:math> where <emphasis effect="italics">v</emphasis> is speed and <emphasis effect="italics">r</emphasis> is the radius of curvature. So by decreasing the curvature (1/<emphasis effect="italics">r</emphasis>) of the path that the car takes, we reduce the amount of force the tires have to exert on the road, meaning we can now increase the speed, <emphasis effect="italics">v</emphasis>. Looking at this from the point of view of the driver on Path 1, we can reason this way: the sharper the turn, the smaller the turning circle; the smaller the turning circle, the larger is the required centripetal force. If this centripetal force is not exerted, the result is a skid.</para>
