<para id="fs-id1168328317120">The origin of Earth’s ocean tides has been a subject of continuous investigation for over 2000 years. But the work of Newton is considered to be the beginning of the true understanding of the phenomenon. Ocean tides are the result of gravitational tidal forces. These same tidal forces are present in any astronomical body. They are responsible for the internal heat that creates the volcanic activity on Io, one of Jupiter’s moons, and the breakup of stars that get too close to black holes.</para>

<title>Lunar Tides</title>
<para id="fs-id1168325667942">If you live on an ocean shore almost anywhere in the world, you can observe the rising and falling of the sea level about twice per day. This is caused by a combination of Earth’s rotation about its axis and the gravitational attraction of both the Moon and the Sun.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168327911126">Let’s consider the effect of the Moon first. In <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_13_06_MoonTides"/>, we are looking “down” onto Earth’s North Pole. One side of Earth is closer to the Moon than the other side, by a distance equal to Earth’s diameter. Hence, the gravitational force is greater on the near side than on the far side. The magnitude at the center of Earth is between these values. This is why a tidal bulge appears on both sides of Earth.</para>

The moon is shown to the right of the earth, moving counterclockwise. The left side of the ellipse is labeled as High tide, with a note that says “on far side, moon pulls earth more than water, creating a high tide.” The right side of the ellipse is labeled as High tide, with a note that says “on near side, moon pulls water more than earth, creating a high tide.” The top and bottom of the ellipse are labeled “Low tide.”">

<caption>The tidal force stretches Earth along the line between Earth and the Moon. It is the <emphasis effect="italics">difference</emphasis> between the gravitational force from the far side to the near side that creates the tidal bulge on both sides of the planet. Tidal variations of the oceans are on the order of few meters; hence, this diagram is greatly exaggerated.</caption>

<para id="fs-id1168325736827">The net force on Earth causes it to orbit about the Earth-Moon center of mass, located about 1600 km below Earth’s surface along the line between Earth and the Moon. The <term>tidal force</term> can be viewed as the <emphasis effect="italics">difference</emphasis> between the force at the center of Earth and that at any other location. In <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_13_06_TidalForce"/>, this difference is shown at sea level, where we observe the ocean tides. (Note that the change in sea level caused by these tidal forces is measured from the baseline sea level. We saw earlier that Earth bulges many kilometers at the equator due to its rotation. This defines the baseline sea level and here we consider only the much smaller tidal bulge measured from that baseline sea level.)</para>

As we move away from the poles, the arrows get longer and point increasingly away from the center. At 45 degrees, the arrows are tangent to the surface and point toward the equator. At the equator, the arrows are longest and point directly outward.">

</figure>
<para id="fs-id1168327886893">Why does the rise and fall of the tides occur twice per day? Look again at <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_13_06_MoonTides"/>. If Earth were not rotating and the Moon was fixed, then the bulges would remain in the same location on Earth. Relative to the Moon, the bulges stay fixed—along the line connecting Earth and the Moon. But Earth rotates (in the direction shown by the blue arrow) approximately every 24 hours. In 6 hours, the near and far locations of Earth move to where the low tides are occurring, and 6 hours later, those locations are back to the high-tide position. Since the Moon also orbits Earth approximately every 28 days, and in the same direction as Earth rotates, the time between high (and low) tides is actually about 12.5 hours. The actual timing of the tides is complicated by numerous factors, the most important of which is another astronomical body—the Sun.</para>

<title>The Effect of the Sun on Tides</title>
<para id="fs-id1168325631618">In addition to the Moon’s tidal forces on Earth’s oceans, the Sun exerts a tidal force as well. The gravitational attraction of the Sun on any object on Earth is nearly 200 times that of the Moon. However, as we show later in an example, the <emphasis effect="italics">tidal</emphasis> effect of the Sun is less than that of the Moon, but a significant effect nevertheless. Depending upon the positions of the Moon and Sun relative to Earth, the net tidal effect can be amplified or attenuated.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168327910634"><link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_13_06_MoonTides"/> illustrates the relative positions of the Sun and the Moon that create the largest tides, called <term>spring tide</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis> (or leap tides). During spring tides, Earth, the Moon, and the Sun are aligned and the tidal effects add. (Recall that the tidal forces cause bulges on both sides.) <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_13_06_MoonTides"/>(c) shows the relative positions for the smallest tides, called <term>neap tide</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis>. The extremes of both high and low tides are affected. Spring tides occur during the new or full moon, and neap tides occur at half-moon.</para>

<title>The Magnitude of the Tides</title>
<para id="fs-id1168327925210">With accurate data for the positions of the Moon and the Sun, the time of maximum and minimum tides at most locations on our planet can be predicted accurately.</para>

</note>
<para id="fs-id1168328303878">The magnitude of the tides, however, is far more complicated. The relative angles of Earth and the Moon determine spring and neap tides, but the magnitudes of these tides are affected by the distances from Earth as well. Tidal forces are greater when the distances are smaller. Both the Moon’s orbit about Earth and Earth’s orbit about the Sun are elliptical, so a spring tide is exceptionally large if it occurs when the Moon is at perigee and Earth is at perihelion. Conversely, it is relatively small if it occurs when the Moon is at apogee and Earth is at aphelion.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168328214407">The greatest causes of tide variation are the topography of the local shoreline and the bathymetry (the profile of the depth) of the ocean floor. The range of tides due to these effects is astounding. Although ocean tides are much smaller than a meter in many places around the globe, the tides at the Bay of Fundy (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_13_06_Fundy"/>), on the east coast of Canada, can be as much as 16.3 meters.</para>

Note that the forces exerted by the Sun are nearly 200 times greater than the forces exerted by the Moon. But the <emphasis effect="italics">difference</emphasis> in those forces for the Sun is half that for the Moon. This is the nature of tidal forces. The Moon has a greater tidal effect because the fractional change in distance from the near side to the far side is so much greater for the Moon than it is for the Sun.</para>

<para id="fs-id1168327925034"><emphasis effect="bold">Check Your Understanding</emphasis> Earth exerts a tidal force on the Moon. Is it greater than, the same as, or less than that of the Moon on Earth? Be careful in your response, as tidal forces arise from the <emphasis effect="italics">difference</emphasis> in gravitational forces between one side and the other. Look at the calculations we performed for the tidal force on Earth and consider the values that would change significantly for the Moon. The diameter of the Moon is one-fourth that of Earth.

<title>Other Tidal Effects</title>
<para id="fs-id1168325697191">Tidal forces exist between any two bodies. The effect stretches the bodies along the line between their centers. Although the tidal effect on Earth’s seas is observable on a daily basis, long-term consequences cannot be observed so easily. One consequence is the dissipation of rotational energy due to friction during flexure of the bodies themselves. Earth’s rotation rate is slowing down as the tidal forces transfer rotational energy into heat. The other effect, related to this dissipation and conservation of angular momentum, is called “locking” or tidal synchronization. It has already happened to most moons in our solar system, including Earth’s Moon. The Moon keeps one face toward Earth—its rotation rate has locked into the orbital rate about Earth. The same process is happening to Earth, and eventually it will keep one face toward the Moon. If that does happen, we would no longer see tides, as the tidal bulge would remain in the same place on Earth, and half the planet would never see the Moon. However, this locking will take many billions of years, perhaps not before our Sun expires.</para>
<para id="fs-id1168328293060">One of the more dramatic example of tidal effects is found on <term class="no-emphasis">Io</term>, one of Jupiter’s moons. In 1979, the <emphasis effect="italics">Voyager</emphasis> spacecraft sent back dramatic images of volcanic activity on Io. It is the only other astronomical body in our solar system on which we have found such activity. <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_13_06_Io"/> shows a more recent picture of Io taken by the <emphasis effect="italics">New Horizons</emphasis> spacecraft on its way to Pluto, while using a gravity assist from Jupiter.</para>

The tidal forces in very close binary systems can be strong enough to rip matter from one star to the other, once the tidal forces exceed the cohesive self-gravitational forces that hold the stars together. This effect can be seen in normal stars that orbit nearby compact stars, such as neutron stars or black holes. <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_13_06_accretion"/> shows an artist’s rendition of this process. As matter falls into the compact star, it forms an accretion disc that becomes super-heated and radiates in the X-ray spectrum.</para>

<caption>Tidal forces from a compact object can tear matter away from an orbiting star.

Kornmesser)</caption></figure><para id="fs-id1168328173466">The energy output of these binary systems can exceed the typical output of thousands of stars. Another example might be a quasar. Quasars are very distant and immensely bright objects, often exceeding the energy output of entire galaxies. It is the general consensus among astronomers that they are, in fact, massive black holes producing radiant energy as matter that has been tidally ripped from nearby stars falls into them.</para>
