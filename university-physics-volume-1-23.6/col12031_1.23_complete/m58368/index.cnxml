<para id="fs-id1165036972656">We saw in <link document="m58360">Oscillations</link> that oscillatory motion is an important type of behavior that can be used to model a wide range of physical phenomena. Oscillatory motion is also important because oscillations can generate waves, which are of fundamental importance in physics. Many of the terms and equations we studied in the chapter on oscillations apply equally well to wave motion (<link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_16_01_Wave"/>).</para>

<caption>An ocean wave is probably the first picture that comes to mind when you hear the word “wave.” Although this breaking wave, and ocean waves in general, have apparent similarities to the basic wave characteristics we will discuss, the mechanisms driving ocean waves are highly complex and beyond the scope of this chapter. It may seem natural, and even advantageous, to apply the concepts in this chapter to ocean waves, but ocean waves are nonlinear, and the simple models presented in this chapter do not fully explain them.

<title>Types of Waves</title>
<para id="fs-id1165037071513">A <term>wave</term> is a disturbance that propagates, or moves from the place it was created. There are three basic types of waves: mechanical waves, electromagnetic waves, and matter waves.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165037058292">Basic <term>mechanical wave</term><emphasis effect="bold">s</emphasis> are governed by Newton’s laws and require a medium. A <term class="no-emphasis">medium</term> is the substance a mechanical waves propagates through, and the medium produces an elastic restoring force when it is deformed. Mechanical waves transfer energy and momentum, without transferring mass. Some examples of mechanical waves are water waves, sound waves, and seismic waves. The medium for water waves is water; for sound waves, the medium is usually air. (Sound waves can travel in other media as well; we will look at that in more detail in <link document="m58374">Sound</link>.) For surface water waves, the disturbance occurs on the surface of the water, perhaps created by a rock thrown into a pond or by a swimmer splashing the surface repeatedly. For sound waves, the disturbance is a change in air pressure, perhaps created by the oscillating cone inside a speaker or a vibrating tuning fork. In both cases, the disturbance is the oscillation of the molecules of the fluid. In mechanical waves, energy and momentum transfer with the motion of the wave, whereas the mass oscillates around an equilibrium point. (We discuss this in <link document="m58371">Energy and Power of a Wave</link>.) Earthquakes generate seismic waves from several types of disturbances, including the disturbance of Earth’s surface and pressure disturbances under the surface. Seismic waves travel through the solids and liquids that form Earth. In this chapter, we focus on mechanical waves.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165038299416"><term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Electromagnetic waves</emphasis></term> are associated with oscillations in electric and magnetic fields and do not require a medium. Examples include gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet waves, visible light, infrared waves, microwaves, and radio waves. Electromagnetic waves can travel through a vacuum at the speed of light, <m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>v</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mi>c</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mn>2.99792458</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mo>×</m:mo><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:msup><m:mrow><m:mn>10</m:mn></m:mrow><m:mn>8</m:mn></m:msup><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>m/s</m:mtext><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> For example, light from distant stars travels through the vacuum of space and reaches Earth. Electromagnetic waves have some characteristics that are similar to mechanical waves; they are covered in more detail in <link document="m58495">Electromagnetic Waves</link>.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165036737923"><term class="no-emphasis"><emphasis effect="italics">Matter waves</emphasis></term> are a central part of the branch of physics known as quantum mechanics. These waves are associated with protons, electrons, neutrons, and other fundamental particles found in nature. The theory that all types of matter have wave-like properties was first proposed by Louis de Broglie in 1924. Matter waves are discussed in <link document="m58757">Photons and Matter Waves</link>.</para>

<title>Mechanical Waves</title>
<para id="fs-id1165036792255">Mechanical waves exhibit characteristics common to all waves, such as amplitude, wavelength, period, frequency, and energy. All wave characteristics can be described by a small set of underlying principles.</para>
<para id="fs-id1165037160786">The simplest mechanical waves repeat themselves for several cycles and are associated with simple harmonic motion. These simple harmonic waves can be modeled using some combination of sine and cosine functions. For example, consider the simplified surface water wave that moves across the surface of water as illustrated in <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_16_01_SeaGull"/>. Unlike complex ocean waves, in surface water waves, the medium, in this case water, moves vertically, oscillating up and down, whereas the disturbance of the wave moves horizontally through the medium. In <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_16_01_SeaGull"/>, the waves causes a seagull to move up and down in simple harmonic motion as the wave crests and troughs (peaks and valleys) pass under the bird. The crest is the highest point of the wave, and the trough is the lowest part of the wave. The time for one complete oscillation of the up-and-down motion is the wave’s period <emphasis effect="italics">T</emphasis>. The wave’s frequency is the number of waves that pass through a point per unit time and is equal to <m:math><m:mrow><m:mi>f</m:mi><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mn>1</m:mn><m:mtext>/</m:mtext><m:mi>T</m:mi><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math> The period can be expressed using any convenient unit of time but is usually measured in seconds; frequency is usually measured in hertz (Hz), where <m:math><m:mrow><m:mn>1</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:msup><m:mrow><m:mtext>Hz</m:mtext><m:mo>=</m:mo><m:mn>1</m:mn><m:mspace width="0.2em"/><m:mtext>s</m:mtext></m:mrow><m:mrow><m:mn>−1</m:mn></m:mrow></m:msup><m:mo>.</m:mo></m:mrow></m:math></para>

The wavelength can be measured between any two similar points along the medium that have the same height and the same slope. In <link target-id="CNX_UPhysics_16_01_SeaGull"/>, the wavelength is shown measured between two crests. As stated above, the period of the wave is equal to the time for one oscillation, but it is also equal to the time for one wavelength to pass through a point along the wave’s path.</para>

<para id="fs-id1165037168397">Waves may be transverse, longitudinal, or a combination of the two. Examples of transverse waves are the waves on stringed instruments or surface waves on water, such as ripples moving on a pond. Sound waves in air and water are longitudinal. With sound waves, the disturbances are periodic variations in pressure that are transmitted in fluids. Fluids do not have appreciable shear strength, and for this reason, the sound waves in them are longitudinal waves. Sound in solids can have both longitudinal and transverse components, such as those in a seismic wave. Earthquakes generate seismic waves under Earth’s surface with both longitudinal and transverse components (called compressional or P-waves and shear or S-waves, respectively). The components of seismic waves have important individual characteristics—they propagate at different speeds, for example. Earthquakes also have surface waves that are similar to surface waves on water. Ocean waves also have both transverse and longitudinal components.</para>
